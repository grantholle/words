I was born in Iowa, raised in Missouri, and I am currently living in Tianjin, China.

I am passionate about web technology and love creating things for the web. It's fun, challenging and very rewarding to me.

I've learned a lot about myself and life since living in China, and would encourage anyone who is able to live abroad for an extended period of time. One gains a broader view of the world when you're outside of the "comfortable."

I'm also passionate about Jesus and what it means to follow his teachings in the world in which we live.

All views and opinions expressed are purely my own and may or may not match those of my employers, clients, family or friends.
