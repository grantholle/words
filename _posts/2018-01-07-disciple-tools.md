I've the opportunity to meet a lot of really amazing people. A group of those people are involved in creating a very important piece of software called [disciple.tools](https://disciple.tools/).

CRM (customer relationship management) software is quite popular and helps businesses maintain relationships with existing customers. It's a very important piece of software for a business, which is why lots of companies shell out big bucks to customize a solution to best fit their needs. Disciple Tools takes that idea and modifies it to fit another important need: maintaining relationships with believers and tracking their journey.

It spawned out of something they created using [Podio](https://podio.com/). They were able to use that system to manage their contacts and relationships. It worked for them, but in talking with others found that other groups in other parts of the world also wanted to leverage technology for the Kingdom, so they decided to make something they could package and distribute. They needed something else.

When the creators were first talking to me about it and what they were thinking, they wanted it to be easy to install and use (duh). They were thinking about using Wordpress since it's a widely used and trusted platform. What they ended up creating was an [admin plugin](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools) and a front-end [theme](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme) to help manage and track contacts' progress in disciple-making. I think it's really smart to take this approach because most hosts have an "easy install" for WP, and then installing these plugins would take no time at all. And the best part to me is that they've open sourced the entire thing.

What they need now are people to contribute to the project. The core group of developers need the open-source community to chip in. There's a massive group of believing developers that could take on one issue to help get them accomplish their goals. Having known the people behind the project for a long time, they are visionaries. Once this is finished, they'll work on the next iteration or find the next need that can be filled with technology. They've brought the mission field into the 21st century.

Another really exciting part about this project is there are plans to aggregate the stats from all the users of the plugin into one place. This could provide insanely accurate numbers of believers throughout the world. This tool is extremely helpful to workers in the field to track their contacts and to keep them involved and on mission.

Will you help them? Please contribute and get the word out. Use your skills and tools to impact the Kingdom!
