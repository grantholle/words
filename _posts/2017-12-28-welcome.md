Well, I've joined the people-with-a-blog group. My *words*, if you will.

Will I use it? Probably not. Do I hope I use it? Sort of, yeah.

My plan is to share about my development discoveries, life and whatever else comes to my mind. Tech reviews, maybe. Rants, probably.

This is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a modified [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/) theme that is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for *free*. I like it because I can do it all from my text editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) at the moment) using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It kind of feels like I'm coding and writing at the same time, so it's a little more fun for me.
