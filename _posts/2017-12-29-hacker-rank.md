Recently I realized I need more "technical" knowledge about computer science-y things. *Algorithms*, *data structures*, and *BigO* were things I had heard about but about which knew nothing. This is because I don't have a CS degree, but a "Computer Information Systems" degree.

Because at the time (when I was a junior in college) trying to decide what I wanted to major in, I was lazy and wanted the path of least resistance. This was before I had ever heard of [Growth Mindset](https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/). I had never written a line of code until my junior year in college (and it was a really bad line of code, too). Anyway...

I realized that if I wanted to be taken seriously in interviews and in companies, I needed to know more about this stuff. I picked up *[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)*, not because I'm looking to interview, but because it has a lot of good general knowledge. Somehow doing a google search or something along these lines, I found a site called [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/aboutus).

It's super cool for someone like me. I gives me lots of practice in general algorithms and helps me think better. They hold contests, which is super cool. From their website:

> The HackerRank team is on a mission to match every developer in the world to the right job by providing a technical recruiting platform that assesses developers based on actual coding skills.

Places like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc are sort of like the holy grails for developers. Notoriously difficult to get hired, but amazing benefits and the bragging rights to say you work there.

When I was about to graduate I did my rounds of interviews, some required whiteboard coding. My coding skills at the time were... *bad*. And whiteboard interviews were seriously some of the scariest situations in my life. I did sooooo bad. The bummer part is that HackerRank existed during that time, so I could have been practicing!

While I don't necessarily desire to work at those tech companies, learning about this stuff and practicing can only help me as a developer in whatever company I want to work. It has really given me a boost developer confidence. HackerRank even has job postings as well.

Between sites like HackerRank and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?med=site-ui&ref=jobs-tab) providing job listings, there are lots of opportunities to find a great job. Now I just have to be good enough to get them!
