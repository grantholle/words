Out of habit, I refer to Mandarin Chinese as simply "Chinese". Technically it's true that "Chinese" is Mandarin since that's the official language of The People's Republic of China (interestingly, that is the translation of the official name of the country, of which the shortened name is just "China" (中国)). There are thousands(?) of dialects, plus Cantonese is technically "Chinese", too... Anyway. When I say "Chinese" I mean Mandarin, 普通话, literally translated: "common speech".

Having lived in China and studied Chinese for over 3 years now, I can verify that it is a difficult language to learn. For me, Chinese is my second language. I've learned some French and Spanish, but nothing close to fluency. I consider myself having a low fluency of Chinese. I haven't taken any of the HSK tests, but I think with a little studying I could pass HSK5. I thought I would share an insight that most people who study it know, but I think it's still worth talking about.

__Note__: I can only speak from a native English speaker perspective.

## The difficulty

So, what makes Chinese hard? The first reason I think of is that it's tonal.

### Tones

As a kid, mimicking Chinese typically involved saying something like: "chingchongchingchong". We've all done it. But the tones are so different than a Latin-based language like English and Spanish. It's like sing-talking to me. I also should say that I am a terrible singer.

As you can see, for the first tone, you hold a high, level pitch when saying a syllable. The simple example is "ma", because the pronunciation is so close to the English "ma". In English we could say, "Ma?" We would have a rising tone because that's how you pose questions in English. The Chinese tone-equivalent is romanized as má. In English, no matter how you say "ma," the meaning never changes. Not in Chinese. Each tone of the same syllable bears a different meaning altogether: mā, má, mǎ, and mà... in summation: HARD!

### Grammar

Another diffulty is the different grammar structure. It's one of the hardest things to get right when first starting. I still struggle with it sometimes. For example:

English: I am going to the library tomorrow with John.
Chinese: I tomorrow am with John going to the library.

Something like that. Anyway, it's different and hard.

## The simplicity

### Sounds

There's actually a pretty limited number of sounds in Chinese. Taking a look at a [pinyin chart](https://www.yoyochinese.com/chinese-learning-tools/Mandarin-Chinese-pronunciation-lesson/pinyin-chart-table). Each one of those words are all the words/syllables in Chinese. Different words are made by combining those syllables. Simple, right?!

### Word formation

Take shǒu (手, hand) and jī (机, machine). Can you guess what hand machine is? Cell phone!

So, it's kind of like an avalanche. At first, learning is really slow. Learning the basics takes diligence and hard work, but more words start to come together logically and can be remembered easily and more quickly.

The biggest mental hurdle for me starting out was that the pronuciation and tones are radically different that English, and I should stop trying to relate it to English. These are just a couple of things that make it tough to learn. But like I said, as you learn more, you start to advance faster and faster.
