I should preface this by saying that I don't know the current adoption rate of Apple/Android Pay, but I remember it being not that high last time I was in the US.

China has two super big players in the online payment platform market: Alipay (支付宝) and WeChat Pay (微信支付). I can buy virtually anything I want outside or online with these two vendors. There are others, but these are the two big players.

I think Alipay was pretty fast on the market and they have a great product, so its usage is pretty high. WeChat boasts almost [1 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/) active monthly users. If that's how many monthly users are active, it can be safe to say that's also the *daily* number also. China has a WeChat (and smart phone) addiction. That's another story. It's not only a chat app, it does sooo much more than that. Payment/mobile wallet is a big part of that.

So, what's the big deal? The West has Apple Pay and Android Pay. In Tianjin where I live, I can use either or both of those mobile payments at any convenience store, restaurant, hospital, fruit stand and taxi cab. I *know* that the West doesn't offer that.

Each user can generate a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) to accept payments. Companies can also create official accounts to accept payments, but it's harder to obtain. It has more benefits, though. The average fresh food vendor or restaurant can just put the owner's QR code out, customers can scan and pay instantly. Vendors can even buy a bar code scanner. They input the amount like a credit card machine, and can my barcode/QR code. It's amazingly fast and simple.

In the US I would more than likely use a debit/credit card to pay for stuff. Cash has always been pretty rare for me. But why carry around a card that can very easily get lost or stolen; all you need are the numbers off of it for it to be stolen, too! You're already carrying your phone. You're already using the chat app. There isn't anything more convenient than that. It's something I absolutely love.

Security is obviously a big concern, but I have honestly never felt worried about my information getting stolen. If several hundred million people can use it without issues, so can I. I have honestly never heard of issues coming from either vendor.

Another great bonus is that I can see all the transactions I've made *within the same app*. I'd have to check my credit card or bank account to see the transactions with a credit card. Each system also has "credit" where I have can have a positive balance in my account. When making purchases I can choose my bank card or balance to pay for things.

It reminds me of [Mr. Robot](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/62560-mr-robot) where they use the cryptocurrency "E Coin" and how they use their phones to transfer money and pay for things. This is exactly like that. I don't know the reason people put off setting these up. It takes minutes and the convenience is insane after it's working.

I would be devastated if I couldn't use mobile payments. The US needs to catch up.
